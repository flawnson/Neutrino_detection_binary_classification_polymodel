# Neutrino_detection_binary_classification_polymodel

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

*TODO in lepton.py*

## Project
This is a polymodel made to fit the user's expiramental parameters. The user can define the number of and the type of machine learning models that they want. The program will divide the dataset into equal portions, including that for training and testing. Each model is then trained and their results are aggregated to make a final prediction. The inutition is that the use of multiple machine learning models with different parameters would lower variance without changing bias significantly. The task in thie project is a binary classification of electron neutrinos (signal) and muon neutrinos (background) based on expiramental data used by the University of Michigan.

## Future plans and outcomes
There are many modifications that can be made, including the use of cross-validation methods to further ensure results are clean by reducing the likelihood of overfit models. Another improvement is the use of grid search or another hyperparameter search algorithm to find the best possible configuration for the machine learning models.

Upwards and onwards, always and only :rocket:!
